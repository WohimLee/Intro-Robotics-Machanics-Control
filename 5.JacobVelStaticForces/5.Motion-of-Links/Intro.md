# MOTION OF THE LINKS OF A ROBOT


In considering the motions of robot links, we will always use link frame $\{0\}$ as our reference frame. 

Hence, $v_i$ is the `linear velocity` of the origin of link frame $\{i\}$, and $\omega_i$ is the `angular velocity` of link frame $\{i\}$.

At any instant, each link of a robot in motion has some linear and angular velocity. Figure 5.6 indicates these vectors for link $i$. In this case, it is indicated that they are written in frame $\{i\}$.
