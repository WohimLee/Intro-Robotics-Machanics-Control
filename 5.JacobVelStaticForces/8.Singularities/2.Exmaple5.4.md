# Example 5.4

Where are the singularities of the simple two-link arm of Example 5.3? What is the physical explanation of the singularities? Are they workspace-boundary singularities or workspace-interior singularities?

To find the singular points of a mechanism, we must examine the determinant of its Jacobian. Where the determinant is equal to $0$, the Jacobian has lost full rank and is singular:
$$\operatorname{DET}[J(\Theta)]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
l_1 s_2 & 0 \\
l_1 c_2+l_2 & l_2
\end{array}\right]=l_1 l_2 s_2=0$$

Clearly, a singularity of the mechanism exists when $\theta_2$ is $0$ or $180$ degrees. Physically, when $\theta_2=0$, the arm is stretched straight out. In this configuration, motion of the end-effector is possible along only one Cartesian direction (the one perpendicular to the arm). Therefore, the mechanism has lost one degree of freedom. 

Likewise, when $\theta_2=180$, the arm is folded completely back on itself, and motion of the hand again is possible only in one Cartesian direction instead of two. We will class these singularities as workspace-boundary singularities, because they exist at the edge of the manipulator's workspace. Note that the Jacobian written with respect to frame $\{0\}$, or any other frame, would have yielded the same result.

The danger in applying (5.72) in a robot control system is that, at a singular point, the inverse Jacobian blows up! This results in joint rates approaching infinity as the singularity is approached.
