# Example 5.6

For the PUMA 560 manipulator, give two examples of singularities that can occur.

There is singularity when $\theta_3$ is near $-90.0$ degrees. Calculation of the exact value of $\theta_3$ is left as an exercise. (See Exercise $5.14.$) In this situation, links $2$ and $3$ are "stretched out," just like the singular location of the two-link manipulator in Example 5.3. This is classed as a workspace-boundary singularity.

Whenever $\theta_5 = 0.0$ degrees, the manipulator is in a singular configuration. In this configuration, joint axes $4$ and $6$ line upâ€”both of their actions would result in the same end-effector motion, so it is as if a degree of freedom has been lost.

Because this can occur interior to the workspace envelope, we will class it as a workspace-interior singularity.
