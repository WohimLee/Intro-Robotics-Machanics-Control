# Changing a Jacobian's frame of reference

Given a Jacobian written in frame $\{B\}$, that is,
$$\left[\begin{array}{l}
{ }^B v \\
{ }^B \omega
\end{array}\right]={ }^B \nu={ }^B J(\Theta) \dot{\Theta} \tag{5.68}$$



we might be interested in giving an expression for the Jacobian in another frame, $\{A\}$. First, note that a $6 \times 1$ Cartesian velocity vector given in $\{B\}$ is described relative to $\{A\}$ by the transformation

$$\left[\begin{array}{c}
{ }^A v \\
{ }^A \omega
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c|c}
{ }^A_B R & 0 \\
\hline 0 & { }_B^A R
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
{ }^B v \\
{ }^B \omega
\end{array}\right] \tag{5.69}$$

Hence, we can write
$$\left[\begin{array}{c}
{ }^A v \\
{ }^A \omega\end{array}\right]=
\left[\begin{array}{c|c}
{ }_B^A R & 0 \\
\hline 0 & { }_B^A R
\end{array}\right]{ }^B J(\Theta) \dot{\Theta} \tag{5.70}$$

Now it is clear that changing the frame of reference of a Jacobian is accomplished by means of the following relationship:

$${ }^A J(\Theta)=\left[\begin{array}{c|c}
{ }_B^A R & 0 \\
\hline 0 & { }_B^A R
\end{array}\right]{ }^B J(\Theta) \tag{5.71}$$
