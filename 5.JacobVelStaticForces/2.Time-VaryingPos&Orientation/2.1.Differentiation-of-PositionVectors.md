# Differentiation of position vectors

As a basis for our consideration of velocities (and, in Chapter 6, accelerations), we need the following notation for the derivative of a vector:

$$V^B_Q = \frac{d}{dt}Q^B = \lim\limits_{\Delta t\rightarrow 0} \frac{Q^B (t+\Delta t) - Q^B(t)}{\Delta t} \tag{5.1}$$

The velocity of a position vector can be thought of as the linear velocity of the point in space represented by the position vector. 

From (5.1), we see that we are calculating the derivative of $Q$ relative to frame $\{B\}$. For example, if $Q$ is not changing in time relative to $\{B\}$, then the velocity calculated is zeroâ€”even if there is some other frame in which $Q$ is varying. Thus, it is important to indicate the frame in which the vector is differentiated.

&emsp;
## In other frame
As with any vector, a velocity vector can be described in terms of any frame, and this frame of reference is noted with a leading superscript. Hence, the velocity vector calculated by (5.1), when expressed in terms of frame $\{A\}$, would be written

$$(V^B_Q)^A = \frac{d}{dt}^A Q^B \tag{5.2}$$

So we see that, in the general case, a velocity vector is associated with a point in space, but the numerical values describing the velocity of that point depend on two frames: 
- one with respect to which the differentiation was done
- one in which the resulting velocity vector is expressed

&emsp;
## In original frame
In (5.1), the calculated velocity is written in terms of the frame of differentiation, so the result could be indicated with a leading $B$ superscript, but, for simplicity, when both superscripts are the same, we needn't indicate the outer one; that is, we write

$$(V^B_Q)^B = V^B_Q \tag{5.3}$$

&emsp;
## Final Notation
Finally, we can always remove the outer, leading superscript by explicitly including the rotation matrix that accomplishes the change in reference frame (see Section 2.10); that is, we write

$$(V^B_Q)^A = R_{AB}V^B_Q \tag{5.4}$$

We will usually write expressions in the form of the right-hand side of (5.4) so that the symbols representing velocities will always mean the velocity in the frame of differentiation and will not have outer, leading superscripts.


## 
Rather than considering a general point's velocity relative to an arbitrary frame, we will very often consider the velocity of the origin of a frame relative to some understood universe reference frame. For this special case, we define a shorthand notation,

$$v_C = V^U_{C\ ORG} \tag{5.5}$$
- $\{C\}$: the origin of frame
- $\{U\}$: the reference frame


For example, we can use the notation to refer to the velocity of the origin of frame $\{C\}$; then $v^A_C$ is the velocity of the origin of frame $\{C\}$ expressed in terms of frame $\{A\}$ (though differentiation was done relative to $\{U\}$)
