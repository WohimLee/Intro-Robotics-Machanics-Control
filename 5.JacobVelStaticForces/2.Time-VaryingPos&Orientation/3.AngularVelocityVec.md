# The angular velocity vector
We now introduce an angular velocity vector, using the symbol Whereas linear velocity describes an attribute of a point, angular velocity describes an attribute of a body. We always attach a frame to the bodies we consider, so we can also think of angular velocity as describing rotational motion of a frame.

In Fig. 5.2, AcB describes the rotation of frame $\{B\}$ relative to $\{A\}$. Physically, at any instant, the direction of $A$ indicates the instantaneous axis of rotation of $\{B\}$ relative to $\{A\}$, and the magnitude of  indicates the speed of rotation. Again,
like any vector, an angular velocity vector may be expressed in any coordinate system, and so another leading superscript may be added; for example, C(Ac2B) is the angular velocity of frame {B} relative to {A} expressed in terms of frame {C}.
