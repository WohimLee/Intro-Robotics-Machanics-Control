# Linear velocity
Consider a frame $\{B\}$ attached to a rigid body. We wish to describe the motion of ${ }^B Q$ relative to frame $\{A\}$, as in Fig. 5.3. We may consider $\{A\}$ to be fixed.

Frame $\{B\}$ is located relative to $\{A\}$, as described by 
- a position vector, ${ }^A P_{B\ O R G}$

- a rotation matrix, ${ }_B^A R$

For the moment, we will assume that
- the `orientation`, ${ }_B^A R$, is not changing with time

- the `motion` of point $Q$ relative to $\{A\}$ is due to ${ }^A P_{B\ O R G}$ or ${ }^B Q$ changing in time.

Solving for the linear velocity of point $Q$ in terms of $\{A\}$ is quite simple. Just express both components of the velocity in terms of $\{A\}$, and sum them:
$$
{ }^A V_Q={ }^A V_{B\ O R G}+{ }_B^A R\ { }^B V_Q \tag{5.7}
$$

Equation (5.7) is for only that case in which relative orientation of $\{B\}$ and $\{A\}$ remains constant.
