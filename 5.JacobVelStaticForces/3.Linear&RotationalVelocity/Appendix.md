# Appendix-2: ${}^AΩ_BΔt$

The term ${}^AΩ_BΔt$ derives from a basic understanding of how angular velocity works in physics. Here's a breakdown:

> Angular Velocity ($Ω$)

- Angular velocity is defined as the rate of change of angular displacement with respect to time. It essentially tells us how quickly something is rotating.
- In mathematical terms, if you have an angular velocity $Ω$
Ω, the amount of rotation (angular displacement) $θ$ that occurs over a time interval $Δt$ can be described as:

    $$θ=Ω×Δt$$

    This equation tells us that the total rotation is simply the speed of rotation ($Ω$) multiplied by the duration of rotation ($Δt$).

>Physical Intuition
- Think of it like how you'd compute distance in linear motion. If you know the velocity $v$ of an object and you want to find out how far the object has moved in a certain time $Δt$, you'd compute the displacement as:

    $$displacement=v×Δt$$

- Similarly, in rotational motion, the `distance traveled` in the rotational sense is the angular displacement, and it's calculated with the angular velocity $Ω$ and the time $Δt$



So, ${}^AΩ_BΔt$ gives the total angular displacement (how much rotation has occurred) of the vector in the time interval $Δt$ due to the angular velocity ${}^AΩ_B$
