# Other representations of angular velocity

Other representations of angular velocity are possible; for example, imagine that the angular velocity of a rotating body is available as rates of the set of $Z—Y—Z$ Euler angles:

$$\dot{\Theta}_{Z^{\prime} Y^{\prime} Z^{\prime}}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\dot{\alpha} \\ \dot{\beta} \\ \dot{\gamma}
\end{array}\right] \tag{5.38}$$

Given this style of description, or any other using one of the 24 angle sets, we would like to derive the equivalent angular-velocity vector.

We have seen that

$$\dot{R} R^T=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & -\Omega_z & \Omega_y \\
\Omega_z & 0 & -\Omega_x \\
-\Omega_y & \Omega_x & 0
\end{array}\right] \tag{5.39}$$

From this matrix equation, one can extract three independent equations, namely,

$$\begin{aligned}
& \Omega_x=\dot{r}_{31} r_{21}+\dot{r}_{32} r_{22}+\dot{r}_{33} r_{23}, \\
& \Omega_y=\dot{r}_{11} r_{31}+\dot{r}_{12} r_{32}+\dot{r}_{13} r_{33}, \\
& \Omega_z=\dot{r}_{21} r_{11}+\dot{r}_{22} r_{12}+\dot{r}_{23} r_{13} 
\end{aligned} \tag{5.40}$$

From $(5.40)$ and a symbolic description of $R$ in terms of an angle set, one can derive the expressions that relate the angle-set velocities to the equivalent angular-velocity vector. The resulting expressions can be cast in matrix form-for example, for $\mathrm{Z}-\mathrm{Y}-\mathrm{Z}$ Euler angles,

$$\Omega=E_{Z^{\prime} Y^{\prime} Z^{\prime}}\left(\Theta_{Z^{\prime} Y^{\prime} Z^{\prime}}\right) \dot{\Theta}_{Z^{\prime} Y^{\prime} Z^{\prime}} \tag{5.41}$$

That is, $E(\cdot)$ is a Jacobian relating an angle-set velocity vector to the angular-velocity vector and is a function of the instantaneous values of the angle set. The form of $E(\cdot)$ depends on the particular angle set it is developed for; hence, a subscript is added to indicate which.
