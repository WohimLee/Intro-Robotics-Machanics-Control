# Gaining physical insight concerning the angular-velocity vector

$${ }^A V_P={ }^A \Omega_B \times{ }^A P \tag{5.28}$$

Having concluded that there exists some vector $\Omega$ such that (5.28) is true, we now wish to gain some insight as to its physical meaning. Derive $\Omega$ by direct differentiation of a rotation matrix; that is,

$$\dot{R}=\lim _{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{R(t+\Delta t)-R(t)}{\Delta t} \tag{5.29}$$

Now, write $R(t+\Delta t)$ as the composition of two matrices, namely,

$$R(t+\Delta t)=R_K(\Delta \theta) R(t) \tag{5.30}$$

where, over the interval $\Delta t$, a small rotation of $\Delta \theta$ has occurred about axis $\hat{K}$. Using (5.30), write (5.29) as

$$\dot{R}=\lim _{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\left(\frac{R_K(\Delta \theta)-I_3}{\Delta t} R(t)\right ) \tag{5.31}$$

that is,

$$\dot{R}=\left(\lim _{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{R_K(\Delta \theta)-I_3}{\Delta t}\right) R(t) \tag{5.32}$$

Now, from small angle substitutions in (2.80), we have

$$R_K(\Delta \theta)=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & -k_z \Delta \theta & k_y \Delta \theta \\
k_z \Delta \theta & 1 & -k_x \Delta \theta \\
-k_y \Delta \theta & k_x \Delta \theta & 1
\end{array}\right] \tag{5.33}$$

So, $(5.32)$ may be written

$$\dot{R}=\left(\lim _{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & -k_z \Delta \theta & k_y \Delta \theta \\
k_z \Delta \theta & 0 & -k_x \Delta \theta \\
-k_y \Delta \theta & k_x \Delta \theta & 0
\end{array}\right]}{\Delta t}\right) R(t) \tag{5.34}$$

Finally, dividing the matrix through by $\Delta t$ and then taking the limit, we have

$$\dot{R}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & -k_z \dot{\theta} & k_y \dot{\theta} \\
k_z \dot{\theta} & 0 & -k_x \dot{\theta} \\
-k_y \dot{\theta} & k_x \dot{\theta} & 0
\end{array}\right] R(t) \tag{5.35}$$

Hence, we see that

$$\dot{R} R^{-1}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & -\Omega_z & \Omega_y \\
\Omega_z & 0 & -\Omega_x \\
-\Omega_y & \Omega_x & 0
\end{array}\right] \tag{5.36}$$

where

$$\Omega=\left[\begin{array}{l}
\Omega_x \\
\Omega_y \\
\Omega_z
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
k_x \dot{\theta} \\
k_y \dot{\theta} \\
k_z \dot{\theta}
\end{array}\right]=\dot{\theta} \hat{K} \tag{5.37}$$


The physical meaning of the angular-velocity vector $\Omega$ is that, at any instant, the change in orientation of a rotating frame can be viewed as a rotation about some axis $\hat{K}$. This instantaneous axis of rotation, taken as a unit vector and then scaled by the speed of rotation about that axis ($\dot{\theta}$), yields the angular-velocity vector.
