# A property of the derivative of an orthonormal matrix


We can derive an interesting relationship between the derivative of an orthonormal matrix and a certain skew-symmetric matrix as follows. For any $n \times n$ orthonormal matrix, $R$, we have

$$R R^T=I_n \tag{5.14}$$

where $I_n$ is the $n \times n$ identity matrix. Our interest, by the way, is in the case where $n=3$ and $R$ is a proper orthonormal matrix, or rotation matrix. Differentiating (5.14) yields

$$\dot{R} R^T+R \dot{R}^T=0_n \tag{5.15}$$

where $0_n$ is the $n \times n$ zero matrix. Eq. (5.15) may also be written

$$\dot{R} R^T+\left(\dot{R} R^T\right)^T=0_n \tag{5.16}$$

Defining

$$S=\dot{R} R^T \tag{5.17}$$

we have, from (5.16), that

$$S+S^T=0_n \tag{5.18}$$

So, we see that $S$ is a skew-symmetric matrix. Hence, a property relating the derivative of orthonormal matrices with skew-symmetric matrices exists and can be stated as

$$S=\dot{R} R^{-1} \tag{5.19}$$
