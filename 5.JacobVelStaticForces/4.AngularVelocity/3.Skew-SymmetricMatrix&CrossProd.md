# Skew-symmetric matrices and the vector cross-product

If we assign the elements in a skew-symmetric matrix $S$ as
$$S=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & -\Omega_x & \Omega_y \\
\Omega_x & 0 & -\Omega_x \\
-\Omega_y & \Omega_x & 0
\end{array}\right] \tag{5.25}$$

and define the $3 \times 1$ column vector

$$\Omega=\left[\begin{array}{l}
\Omega_x \\
\Omega_y \\
\Omega_z
\end{array}\right] \tag{5.26}$$

then it is easily verified that

$$S P=\Omega \times P \tag{5.27}$$

where $P$ is any vector, and $\times$ is the vector `cross-product`.


The $3 \times 1$ vector $\Omega$, which corresponds to the $3 \times 3$ angular-velocity matrix, is called the angular-velocity vector and was already introduced in Section 5.2.

Hence, our relation (5.24) 
$${ }^A V_P={ }_B^A S\ { }^A P\tag{5.24}$$

can be written
$${ }^A V_P={ }^A \Omega_B \times{ }^A P \tag{5.28}$$

where we have shown the notation for $\Omega$ indicating that it is the angular-velocity vector specifying the motion of frame $\{B\}$ with respect to frame $\{A\}$.
