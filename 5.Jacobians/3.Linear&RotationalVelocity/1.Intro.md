# LINEAR AND ROTATIONAL VELOCITY OF RIGID BODIES

In this section, we investigate the description of motion of a rigid body, at least as far as `velocity is concerned`. 

These ideas `extend` the notions of translations and orientations described in Chapter 2 to the time-varying case. 


In Chapter 6, we will further extend our study to `considerations of acceleration`.

As in Chapter 2, we attach a coordinate system to any body that we wish to describe. Then, motion of rigid bodies can be equivalently studied as the motion of frames relative to one another.
