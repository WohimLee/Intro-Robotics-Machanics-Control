# Velocity of a point due to rotating reference frame

Consider a fixed vector ${ }^B P$ unchanging with respect to frame $\{B\}$. Its description in another frame $\{A\}$ is given as

$${ }^A P={ }_B^A R^B P \tag{5.20}$$

If frame $\{B\}$ is rotating (i.e., the derivative ${ }_B^A R$ is nonzero), then ${ }^A P$ will be changing even though ${ }^B P$ is constant; that is,

$$\dot{A_P}={ }_B^A R\ { }^B P \tag{5.21}$$

or, using our notation for velocity,

$${ }^A V_P={ }_B^A R\ {}^B P \tag{5.22}$$

Now, rewrite (5.22) by substituting for ${ }^B P$, to obtain

$${ }^A V_P={}^A_B \dot{R}\ {}^A_BR^{-1}\ {}^AP \tag{5.23}$$

Making use of our result (5.19) for orthonormal matrices, we have

$${ }^A V_P={ }_B^A S\ { }^A P\tag{5.24}$$

where we have adorned $S$ with sub- and superscripts to indicate that it is the `skewsymmetric matrix` associated with the particular rotation matrix ${ }_B^A R$. 

>Angular-Velocity Matrix
- Because of ${ }_B^A S$'s appearance in (5.24), and for other reasons to be seen shortly, the skew-symmetric matrix we have introduced is called the `angular-velocity matrix`.
