# 5.4 MORE ON ANGULAR VELOCITY

In this section, we take a deeper look at angular velocity and, in particular, at the derivation of (5.10). 

$${ }^A V_Q={}^A \Omega_B \times{ }^A Q \tag{5.10}$$
Whereas the previous section took a `geometric approach` toward showing the validity of (5.10), here we take a `mathematical approach`. 

This section may be skipped by the first-time reader.
