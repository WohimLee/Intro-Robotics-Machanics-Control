# Intro
We now extend our analysis of rigid-body motion to the case of accelerations. 

At any instant, the linear and angular velocity vectors have derivatives that are called the linear and angular accelerations, respectively. That is,

$$\dot{V}^B_Q = \frac{d}{dt}V^B_Q = \lim\limits_{\Delta t\rightarrow0}\frac{V_Q(t+ \Delta t) - V_Q(t)}{\Delta t}$$

and

As with velocities, when the reference frame of the differentiation is understood to be some universal reference frame, $\{U\}$, we will use the notation



and
