# Intro
We now extend our analysis of rigid-body motion to the case of accelerations. 

At any instant, the linear and angular velocity vectors have derivatives that are called the linear and angular accelerations, respectively. That is,

&emsp;
## 1 Accelerations

>Linear Acceleration
$$\dot{V}^B_Q = \frac{d}{dt}V^B_Q = 
\lim\limits_{\Delta t\rightarrow0}
\frac{V^B_Q(t+ \Delta t) - V^B_Q(t)}{\Delta t} 
\tag{6.1}$$

>Angular Acceleration
$$\dot{\Omega}^A_B = \frac{d}{dt}\Omega^A_B = 
\lim\limits_{\Delta t\rightarrow0}
\frac{\Omega^A_B(t+ \Delta t) - \Omega^A_B(t)}{\Delta t} 
\tag{6.2}$$


&emsp;
## 2 Velocities

As with velocities, when the reference frame of the differentiation is understood to be some universal reference frame, $\{U\}$, we will use the notation

>Linear Velocity

$$\dot{v} = \dot{V}^U_{Aorg} \tag{6.3}$$


>Angular Velocity
$$\dot{\omega} = \dot{\Omega}^U_A \tag{6.4}$$
