# Position and Orientation

In the study of robotics, we are constantly concerned with the location of objects in `three-dimensional space`. These objects are the links of 
- the manipulator
- the parts and tools with which it deals
- other objects in the manipulator's environment.

At a crude but important level, these objects are described by just two attributes:
- Position
- Orientation

Naturally, one topic of immediate interest is the manner in which we represent these quantities and manipulate them mathematically.

In order to describe the position and orientation of a body in space, we will always attach a `coordinate system`, or `frame`, rigidly to the object. We then proceed to describe the position and orientation of this frame with respect to some reference coordinate system. 

&emsp;
## What chapter 2 discuss?
Any frame can serve as a reference system within which to express the position and orientation of a body, so we often think of transforming or changing the description of these attributes of a body from one frame to another. Chapter 2 discusses conventions and methodologies for dealing with the description of position and orientation and the mathematics of manipulating these quantities with respect to various coordinate systems.



Developing good skills concerning the description of position and rotation of rigid bodies is highly useful even in fields outside of robotics.
