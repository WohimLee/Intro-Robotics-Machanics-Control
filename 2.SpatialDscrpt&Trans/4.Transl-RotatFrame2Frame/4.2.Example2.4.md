# Example 2.4

Figure $2.11$ shows a vector ${ }^A P_1$.

We wish to 
- rotate it about $\hat{Z}$ by $30$ degrees 
- translate it $10$ units in $\hat{X}_A$ 
- $5$ units in $\hat{Y}_A$

Find ${ }^A P_2$, where ${ }^A P_1=[3.0, 7.0, 0.0]^T$.



The operator $T$, which performs the translation and rotation, is

$$T=\left[\begin{array}{llll}
0.866 & -0.500 & 0.000 & 10.0 \\
0.500 & 0.866 & 0.000 & 5.0 \\
0.000 & 0.000 & 1.000 & 0.0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right] \tag{2.34}$$

Given
$${ }^A P_1=\left[\begin{array}{l}
3.0 \\ 7.0 \\ 0.0
\end{array}\right] \tag{2.35}$$

we use $T$ as an operator:
$${ }^A P_2=T^A P_1=\left[\begin{array}{r}
9.098 \\ 12.562 \\ 0.000 \end{array}\right]\tag{2.36}$$


Note that this example is numerically exactly the same as Example 2.2, but the interpretation is quite different.
