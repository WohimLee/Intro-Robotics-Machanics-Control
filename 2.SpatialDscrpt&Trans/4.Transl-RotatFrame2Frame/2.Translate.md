# Translational operators

A translation moves a point in space a finite distance along a given vector direction. 

With this interpretation of actually translating the point in space, only one coordinate system need be involved. It turns out that translating the point in space is accomplished with the same mathematics as mapping the point to a second frame. 

Almost always, it is very important to understand which interpretation of the mathematics is being used. The distinction is as simple as this: When a vector is
moved "forward" relative to a frame, we may consider:
- either that the `vector` moved "forward" 
- or that the `frame` moved "backward." 

The mathematics involved in the two cases is identical; only our view of the situation is different.

Figure 2.9 indicates pictorially how a vector ${}^A P_1$ is translated by a vector ${}^A Q$. Here, the vector ${}^A Q$ gives the information needed to perform the translation.


The result of the operation is a new vector ${}^A P_2$, calculated as

$${ }^A P_2={ }^A P_1+{ }^A Q \tag{2.24}$$

To write this translation operation as a matrix operator, we use the notation

$${ }^A P_2=D_Q(q){ }^A P_1 \tag{2.25}$$

where $q$ is the signed magnitude of the translation along the vector direction $\hat{Q}$. The $D_Q$ operator may be thought of as a homogeneous transform of a special simple form:

$$D_Q(q)=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & q_x \\
0 & 1 & 0 & q_y \\
0 & 0 & 1 & q_z \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right] \tag{2.26}$$

- $q_x, q_y$, and $q_z$: the components of the translation vector $Q$
- $q=$ $\sqrt{q_x^2+q_y^2+q_z^2}$. 


Equations $(2.9)$ and $(2.24)$ implement the same mathematics. 
$${ }^A P={ }^B P+{ }^A P_{B\ O R G}\tag{2.9}$$
$${ }^A P_2={ }^A P_1+{ }^A Q \tag{2.24}$$


Note that, if we had defined ${ }^B P_{A\ ORG}$ (instead of ${ }^A P_{B\ O R G}$ ) in Fig. 2.4 and had used it in $(2.9)$, then we would have seen a `sign change` between $(2.9)$ and $(2.24)$.

This sign change would indicate the difference between
- moving the vector "forward"
- moving the coordinate system "backward." 

By defining the location of $\{B\}$ relative to $\{A\}$ (with ${ }^A P_{B\ O R G}$ ), we cause the mathematics of the two interpretations to be the same. Now that the " $D_Q$ " notation has been introduced, we may also use it to describe frames and as a mapping.
