# Transformation operators

As with vectors and rotation matrices, a frame has another interpretation as a transformation operator. In this interpretation, only one coordinate system is involved, and so the symbol $T$ is used without sub- or superscripts. The operator $T$ rotates and translates a vector ${}^A P_1$ to compute a new vector,

$${ }^A P_2=T^A P_1 \tag{2.33}$$

Again, as in the case of rotations, the mathematics described in $(2.18)$ and in $(2.33)$ is the same, only our interpretation is different. This fact also allows us to see how to obtain homogeneous transforms that are to be used as operators:
- The transform that rotates by $R$ and translates by $Q$ is the same as the transform that describes afraine rotated by $R$ and translated by $Q$ relative to the reference frame.


A transform is usually thought of as being in the form of a homogeneous transform with general rotation-matrix and position-vector parts.
