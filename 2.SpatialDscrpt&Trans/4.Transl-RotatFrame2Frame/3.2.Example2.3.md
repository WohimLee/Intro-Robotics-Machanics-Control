# Example 2.3
Figure 2.10 shows a ve
ctor ${ }^A P_1$. We wish to compute the vector obtained by rotating this vector about $\hat{Z}$ by 30 degrees. Call the new vector ${ }^A P_2$.

<div align=center>
    <image src="imgs/2.10.png" width=300>
    <h4>: The vector  rotated 30 degrees about Z</h>
</div>
&emsp;




The rotation matrix that rotates vectors by $30$ degrees about $\hat{Z}$ is the same as the rotation matrix that describes a frame rotated $30$ degrees about $\hat{Z}$ relative to the reference frame. Thus, the correct rotational operator is
$$R_z(30.0)=\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
0.866 & -0.500 & 0.000 \\
0.500 & 0.866 & 0.000 \\
0.000 & 0.000 & 1.000
\end{array}\right] \tag{2.30}$$

Given
$${ }^A P_1=\left[\begin{array}{l}
0.0 \\ 2.0 \\ 0.0\end{array}\right]\tag{2.31}$$

we calculate ${ }^A P_2$ as

$${ }^A P_2=R_z(30.0){ }^A P_1=\left[\begin{array}{r}
-1.000 \\ 1.732 \\ 0.000 \end{array}\right]\tag{2.32}$$

Equations $(2.13)$ and $(2.27)$ implement the same mathematics. 

$${}^A P = {}^A_BR {}^BP \tag{2.13}$$
$${ }^A P_2=R^A P_1 \tag{2.27}$$

Note that, if we had defined ${ }_A^B R$ (instead of ${ }_B^A R$ ) in $(2.13)$, then the inverse of $R$ would appear in $(2.27)$. This change would indicate the difference between 
- rotating the vector "forward" 
- rotating the coordinate system "backward." 

By defining the location of $\{B\}$ relative to $\{A\}$ (by ${ }_B^A R$ ), we cause the mathematics of the two interpretations to be the same.
