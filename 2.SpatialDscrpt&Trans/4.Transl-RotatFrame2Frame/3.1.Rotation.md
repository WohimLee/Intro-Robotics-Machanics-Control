# Rotational operators

Another interpretation of a rotation matrix is as a rotational operator that operates on a vector ${}^A P_1$ and changes that vector to a new vector, ${}^A P_2$, by means of a rotation, $R$. Usually, when a rotation matrix is shown as an operator, no sub- or superscripts appear, because it is not viewed as relating two frames. That is, we may write

$${ }^A P_2=R^A P_1 \tag{2.27}$$


Again, as in the case of translations, the mathematics described in $(2.13)$ and in $(2.27)$ is the same; only our interpretation is different. This fact also allows us to see how to obtain rotational matrices that are to be used as operators:
- The rotation matrix that rotates vectors through some rotation, $R$, is the same as the rotation matrix that describes a frame rotated by $R$ relative to the reference frame.

Although a rotation matrix is easily viewed as an operator, we will also define
another notation for a rotational operator that clearly indicates which `axis` is being rotated about:
$${ }^A P_2=R_K(\theta){ }^A P_1 \tag{2.28}$$

- $R_K(\theta)$: is a rotational operator that performs a rotation about the axis direction $\hat{K}$ by $\theta$ degrees. 

This operator can be written as a homogeneous transform whose position-vector part is zero. For example, substitution into $(2.11)$ yields the operator that rotates about the $\hat{Z}$ axis by $\theta$ as

$$R_z(\Theta)=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 & 0 \\
\sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right] \tag{2.29}$$

Of course, to rotate a position vector, we could just as well use the $3 \times 3$ rotation matrix part of the homogeneous transform. The $R_K$ notation, therefore, may be considered to represent a $3 \times 3$ or a $4 \times 4$ matrix. Later in this chapter, we will see how to write the rotation matrix for a rotation about a general axis $\hat{K}$.
