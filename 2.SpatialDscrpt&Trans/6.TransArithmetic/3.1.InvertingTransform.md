# Inverting a transform

Consider a frame $\{B\}$ that is known with respect to a frame $\{A\}$ - that is, we know the value of ${ }_B^A T$. 


Sometimes we will wish to invert this transform, in order to get a description of $\{A\}$ relative to $\{B\}$ - that is, ${ }_A^B T$. 

A straightforward way of calculating the inverse is to compute the inverse of the $4 \times 4$ homogeneous transform. However, if we do so, we are not taking full advantage of the structure inherent in the transform. It is easy to find a computationally simpler method of computing the inverse, one that does take advantage of this structure.

## Inverse
To find ${ }_A^B T$, we must compute ${ }_A^B R$ and ${ }^B P_{A O R G}$ from ${ }_B^A R$ and ${ }^A P_{B O R G}$. First, recall from our discussion of rotation matrices that
$${ }_A^B R={ }_B^A R^T \tag{2.42}$$

Next, we change the description of ${ }^A P_{B O R G}$ into $\{B\}$ by using (2.13):
$${ }^B\left({ }^A P_{B O R G}\right)={ }_A^B R{ }^A P_{B O R G}+{ }^B P_{A O R G} \tag{2.43}$$


The left-hand side of (2.43) must be zero, so we have
$${ }^B P_{A O R G}=-{ }_A^B R^A P_{B O R G}=-{ }_B^A R^{T A} P_{B O R G} \tag{2.44}$$

Using $(2.42)$ and $(2.44)$, we can write the form of ${ }_A^B T$ as

$${}^B_AT = \left[\begin{array}{c|c}
{}^A_B R^T & - {}^A_BR^T {}^A P_{B\ ORG} \\\\ \hline \\
0\quad 0\quad 0 & 1
\end{array}\right] \tag{2.45}$$

Note that, with our notation,
$${ }_A^B T={ }_B^A T^{-1} $$

Equation $(2.45)$ is a general and extremely useful way of computing the inverse of a homogeneous transform.
