In Fig. 2.12, we have ${}^CP$ and wish to find ${}^AP$

- Frame $\{C\}$ is known relative to frame $\{B\}$
- Frame $\{B\}$ is known relative to frame $\{A\}$

We can transform ${ }^C P$ into ${ }^B P$ as
$${ }^B P={ }_C^B T{ }^C P \tag{2.37}$$

then we can transform ${ }^B P$ into ${ }^A P$ as
$${ }^A P={ }_B^A T{ }^B P \tag{2.38}$$


Combining (2.37) and (2.38), we get the (not unexpected) result
$${ }^A P={ }_B^A T_C^B T^C P \tag{2.39}$$

from which we could define
$${ }_C^A T={ }_B^A T_C^B T \tag{2.40}$$

Again, note that familiarity with the sub- and superscript notation makes these manipulations simple. In terms of the known descriptions of $\{B\}$ and $\{C\}$, we can give the expression for ${ }_C^A T$ as

$${}^A_C T = \begin{bmatrix}
{}^A_B R\ {}^B_C R & {}^A_B R{}^B P_{C\ ORG} + {}^A P_{B\ ORG} \\ \\
0\quad 0\quad 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \tag{2.41}$$
