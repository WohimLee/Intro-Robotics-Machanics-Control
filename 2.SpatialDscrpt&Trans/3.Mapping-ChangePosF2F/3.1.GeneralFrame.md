# Mappings involving general frames

Very often, we know the description of a vector with respect to some frame $\{B\}$, and we would like to know its description with respect to another frame, $\{A\}$. 

We now consider the general case of mapping. Here, the origin of frame $\{B\}$ is not coincident with that of frame $\{A\}$ but has a general vector offset. 
- ${}^AP_{B ORG}$: The vector that locates $\{B\}$'s origin is called ${}^AP_{B ORG}$. 
- ${}^A_BR$: $\{B\}$ is rotated with respect to {A}, as described by ${}^A_BR$. 

Given ${}^B P$ we wish to compute ${}^AP$ as in Fig. 2.7.

&emsp;

We can first change ${}^B P$ to its description relative to an intermediate frame that has the same orientation as $\{A\}$, but whose origin is coincident with the origin of $\{B\}$. This is done by premultiplying by ${}^A_BR$ as in the last section. We then account for the translation between origins by simple vector addition, as before, and obtain

$${}^AP = {}^A_BR\ {}^BP + {}^AP_{B\ ORG} \tag{2.17}$$

Equation $2.17$ describes a general transformation mapping of a vector from its description in one frame to a description in a second frame. Note the following interpretation of our notation as exemplified in $(2.17)$: the $B$'s cancel, leaving all quantities as vectors written in terms of A, which may then be added.

The form of $(2.17)$ is not as appealing as the conceptual form

$${}^A P = {}^A_BT\ {}^BP \tag{2.18}$$

That is, we would like to think of a mapping from one frame to another as an operator in matrix form. This aids in writing compact equations and is conceptually clearer than $(2.17)$. In order that we may write the mathematics given in $(2.17)$ in the matrix operator form suggested by $(2.18)$, we define a $4 \times 4$ matrix operator and use $4 \times 1$ position vectors, so that $(2.18)$ has the structure

$$\left[\begin{array}{c}{}^A P \\ 1 \end{array}\right]=
\begin{bmatrix} {}^A_B R & {}^A P_{B\ ORG} \\ \\
0\ 0\ 0 &1\end{bmatrix}
\left[\begin{array}{c}{}^B P \\ 1\end{array}\right] \tag{2.19}$$

In other words,
1. a `1` is added as the last element of the $4 \times 1$ vectors;
2. a row `[0 0 0 1]` is added as the last row of the $4 \times 4$ matrix.

We adopt the convention that a position vector is $3 \times 1$ or $4 \times 1$, depending on whether it appears multiplied by a $3 \times 3$ matrix or by a $4 \times 4$ matrix. It is readily
seen that $(2.19)$ implements

$$\begin{aligned}
{}^A P & ={ }_B^A R{ }^B P+{ }^A P_{B O R G} \\
1 & =1 \end{aligned} \tag{2.20}$$

## Homogeneous Transform
The $4 \times 4$ matrix in $(2.19)$ is called a homogeneous transform. 

For our purposes, it can be regarded purely as a construction used to cast the rotation and translation of the general transform into a single matrix form. 

In other fields of study, it can be used to compute perspective and scaling operations (when the last row is other than
`[0 0 0 1]` or the rotation matrix is not orthonormal). 

Often, we will write an equation like (2.18) without any notation indicating that it is a homogeneous representation, because it is obvious from context. 

>Note: About Performance
- Note that, although homogeneous transforms are useful in writing compact equations, a computer program to transform vectors would generally `not use them`, because of time wasted multiplying ones and zeros. 
- Thus, this representation is mainly for our convenience when thinking and writing equations down on paper.

Just as we used rotation matrices to specify an `orientation`, we will use transforms (usually in homogeneous representation) to specify a `frame`. 

Observe that, although we have introduced homogeneous transforms in the context of mappings, they also serve as descriptions of frames. The description of frame $\{B\}$ relative to $\{A\}$ is ${}_B^A T$.
