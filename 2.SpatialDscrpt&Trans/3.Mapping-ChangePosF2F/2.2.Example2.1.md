# Example 2.1


Figure 2.6 shows a frame $\{B\}$ that is rotated relative to frame $\{A\}$ about $\hat{Z}$ by $30$ degrees. Here, $\hat{Z}$ is pointing out of the page.

Writing the unit vectors of $\{B\}$ in terms of $\{A\}$ and stacking them as the cohmms of the rotation matrix, we obtain

$${}^A_B R = \begin{bmatrix}
0.866 & -0.500 & 0.000 \\
0.500& 0.866 & 0.000 \\
0.000 & 0.000 & 1.000 \end{bmatrix} \tag{2.14}$$

Given

$${}^BP = [0.0, 2.0, 0.0]^T  \tag{2.15}$$

we calculate ${}^AP$ as 
$${}^A P = {}^A_B R {}^BP = [-1.000, 1.732, 0.000]^T \tag{2.16}$$


Here, ${}^A_BR$ acts as a mapping that is used to describe ${}^B P$ relative to frame $\{A\}$, ${}^AP$. As was introduced in the case of translations, it is important to remember that, viewed as a mapping, the original vector $P$ is not changed in space. Rather, we compute a new description of the vector relative to another frame.
