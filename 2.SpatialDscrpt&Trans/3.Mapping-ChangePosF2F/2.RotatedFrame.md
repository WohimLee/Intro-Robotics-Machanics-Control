# Mappings involving rotated frames

Section 2.2 introduced the notion of describing an `orientation` by three unit vectors denoting the principal axes of a body-attached coordinate system. 

For convenience, we stack these three unit vectors together as the columns of a $3 x 3$ matrix. We will call this matrix a rotation matrix, and, if this particular rotation matrix describes $\{B\}$ relative to $\{A\}$, we name it with the notation ${}^A_BR$.

Note that, by our definition, the columns of a rotation matrix all have unit magnitude, and, further, that these unit vectors are orthogonal. As we saw earlier, a consequence of this is that

$${ }_B^A R={ }_A^B R^{-1}={ }_A^B R^T \tag{2.10}$$
