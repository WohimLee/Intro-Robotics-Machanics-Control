# Intro
In a great many of the problems in robotics, we are concerned with expressing the same quantity in terms of various reference coordinate systems. 

The previous section introduced descriptions of:
- positions
- orientations
- frames

we now consider the mathematics of mapping in order to change descriptions from frame to frame.
