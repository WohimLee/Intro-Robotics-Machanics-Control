# Mappings involving rotated frames

Section 2.2 introduced the notion of describing an `orientation` by three unit vectors denoting the principal axes of a body-attached coordinate system. 

For convenience, we stack these three unit vectors together as the columns of a $3 x 3$ matrix. We will call this matrix a rotation matrix, and, if this particular rotation matrix describes $\{B\}$ relative to $\{A\}$, we name it with the notation ${}^A_BR$.

Note that, by our definition, the columns of a rotation matrix all have unit magnitude, and, further, that these unit vectors are orthogonal. As we saw earlier, a consequence of this is that

$${ }_B^A R={ }_A^B R^{-1}={ }_A^B R^T \tag{2.10}$$

Therefore, because the columns of are the unit vectors of $\{B\}$ written in $\{A\}$, the rows of are the unit vectors of $\{A\}$ written in $\{B\}$.

So a rotation matrix can be interpreted as a set of three column vectors or as a set of three row vectors, as follows:


$${}^A_BR = [{}^A\hat{X}_B,{}^A\hat{Y}_B,{}^A\hat{Z}_B] = \begin{bmatrix}{}^B\hat{X}^T_A \\\\ {}^B\hat{Y}^T_A \\\\ {}^B\hat{Z}^T_A\end{bmatrix}\tag{2.11}$$


As in Fig. 2.5, the situation will arise often where we know the definition of a vector with respect to some frame, $\{B\}$, and we would like to know its definition with respect to another frame, $\{A\}$, where the origins of the two frames are coincident.

This computation is possible when a description of the orientation of $\{B\}$ is known relative to $\{A\}$. This orientation is given by the rotation matrix whose columns are the unit vectors of $\{B\}$ written in $\{A\}$.

In order to calculate ${}^A P$, we note that the components of any vector are simply the projections of that vector onto the unit directions of its frame. The projection is calculated as the vector dot product. Thus, we see that the components of ${}^AP$ may be calculated as

$${}^A p_x = {}^B\hat{X}_A \cdot {}^BP \\
{}^A p_y = {}^B\hat{Y}_A \cdot {}^BP \\ 
{}^A p_z = {}^B\hat{Z}_A \cdot {}^BP \tag{2.12}$$

In order to express (2.13) in terms of a rotation matrix multiplication, we note from (2.11) that the rows of ${}^A_B R$ are ${}^B\hat{X}_A$, ${}^B\hat{Y}_A$ and ${}^B\hat{Z}_A$. So (2.13) may be written compactly, by using a rotation matrix, as

$${}^A P = {}^A_BR {}^BP \tag{2.13}$$

Equation 2.13 implements a mapping—that is, it changes the description of a
vector—from Bp which describes a point in space relative to $\{B\}$, into ${}^AP$, which is a description of the same point, but expressed relative to $\{A\}$.

We now see that our notation is of great help in keeping track of mappings
and frames of reference. A helpful way of viewing the notation we have introduced is to imagine that leading subscripts cancel the leading superscripts of the following entity, for example the Bs in (2.13).
