# Mappings involving translated frames
In Fig. 2.4, we have a position defined by the vector ${}^BP$. We wish to express this point in space in terms of frame $\{A\}$, when $\{A\}$ has the same `orientation` as $\{B\}$. 

In this case, $\{B\}$ differs from $\{A\}$ only by a `translation`, which is given by ${}^AP_{B\ ORG}$, a vector that locates the origin of $\{B\}$ relative to $\{A\}$.

Because both vectors are defined relative to frames of the same orientation, we calculate the description of point $P$ relative to $\{A\}$, ${}^AP$ by vector addition:

$${ }^A P={ }^B P+{ }^A P_{B\ O R G}\tag{2.9}$$

Note that only in the special case of equivalent orientations may we add vectors that are defined in terms of different frames.

In this simple example, we have illustrated mapping a vector from one frame to another. This idea of mapping, or changing the description from one frame to another, is an extremely important concept. The quantity itself (here, a point in space) is not changed; only its description is changed. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.4, where the point described by ${}^B P$ is not translated, but remains the same, and instead we have computed a new description of the same point, but now with respect to system $\{A\}$.


We say that the vector $A$ defines this mapping because all the information needed to perform the change in description is contained in ${}^AP_{B\ ORG}$ (along with the knowledge that the frames had equivalent orientation)
