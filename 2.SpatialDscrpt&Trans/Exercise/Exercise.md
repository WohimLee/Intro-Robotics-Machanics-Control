## 
Write a subroutine to multiply two transforms together. Use the following procedure heading:
```c++
void TMULT (frame Tab, frame Tbc, frame res);
```
The first two arguments are inputs, and the third is an output. Note that the names of the arguments document what the program does(brela=$T_{AB}$)
