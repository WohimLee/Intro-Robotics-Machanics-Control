# Example 2.6


Assume that we know in Fig. $2.16$: 


- ${}_T^B T$: describes the frame at the manipulator's fingertips $\{T\}$ relative to the base of the manipulator, $\{B\}$

- ${ }_S^B T$: where the tabletop is located in space relative to the manipulator's base (because we have a description of the frame $\{S\}$ that is attached to the table as shown, ${ }_S^B T$ )
- ${ }_G^S T$: the location of the frame attached to the bolt lying on the table relative to the table frame

Calculate the position and orientation of the bolt relative to the manipulator's hand, ${ }_G^T T$.

Guided by our notation (and, it is hoped, our understanding), we compute the bolt frame relative to the hand frame as

$${}_G^T T={ }_T^B T-1{ }_S^B T{ }_G^S T \tag{2.55}$$
