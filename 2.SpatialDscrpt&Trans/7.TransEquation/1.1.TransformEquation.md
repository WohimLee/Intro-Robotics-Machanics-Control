# Transform Equations

Figure 2.14 indicates a situation in which a frame $\{D\}$ can be expressed as products of transformations in two different ways.

First,

$${ }_D^U T={ }_A^U T\ { }_D^A T \tag{2.48}$$

second;

$${ }_D^U T={}_B^U T\ {}_C^B T\ {}_D^C T \tag{2.49}$$

We can set these two descriptions of ${ }_D^U T$ equal to construct a `transform equatio`n:
$${ }_A^U T{ }_D^A T={}_B^U T\ {}_C^B T\ {}_D^C T \tag{2.50}$$


Transform equations can be used to solve for transforms in the case of $n$ unknown transforms and $n$ transform equations. Consider $(2.50)$ in the case that all transforms are known except ${}^B_C T$.

Here, we have one transform equation and one unknown transform; hence, we easily find its solution to be

$${}_C^B T={ }_B^U T\ {}_A^{-1}\ T_D^A\ T_D^C\ T^{-1}\tag{2.51}$$

Figure $2.15$ indicates a similar situation.

Note that, in all figures, we have introduced a graphical representation of frames as an arrow pointing from one origin to another origin. The arrow's direction indicates which way the frames are defined: In Fig. $2.14$, frame $\{D\}$ is defined relative to $\{A\}$; in Fig. 2.15, frame $\{A\}$ is defined relative to $\{D\}$. 

In order to compound frames when the arrows line up, we simply compute the product of the transforms. If an arrow points the opposite way in a chain of transforms, we simply compute its inverse first. In Fig. $2.15$, two possible descriptions of $\{C\}$ are

$${}_C^U T={ }_A^U T\ {}_A^D\ T^{-1}{ }_C^D\ T \tag{2.52}$$

and

$${}_C^U T={ }_B^U T{ }_C^B T \tag{2.53}$$

Again, we might equate $(2.52)$ and $(2.53)$ to solve for, say, ${}_A^U T$ :
$${ }_A^U T={ }_B^U T{ }_C^B T{ }_C^D T^{-1}{ }_A^D T \tag{2.54}$$
