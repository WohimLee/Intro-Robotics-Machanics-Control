# X-Y-Z fixed angles

One method of describing the orientation of a frame $\{B\}$ is as follows:
- Start with the frame coincident with a known reference frame $\{A\}$

- Rotate $\{B\}$ first about $\hat{X}_A$ by an angle $\gamma$
- then about $\hat{Y}_A$ by an angle $\beta$
- finally, about $\hat{Z}_A$ by an angle $\alpha$


Each of the three rotations takes place about an axis in the fixed reference frame $\{A\}$. We will call this convention for specifying an orientation `X-Y-Z fixed angles`. 

The word "fixed" refers to the fact that the rotations are specified about the fixed ($i.e.$, nonmoving) reference frame (Fig. $2.17$).

Sometimes this convention is referred to as `roll, pitch, yaw` angles, but care must be used, as this name is often given to other related but different conventions.

## Derivation
The derivation of the equivalent rotation matrix, ${ }_B^A R_{X Y Z}(\gamma, \beta, \alpha)$, is straightforward, because all rotations occur about axes of the reference frame; that is,
$$
\begin{aligned}
{ }_B^A R_{X Y Z}(\gamma, \beta, \alpha) & =R_Z(\alpha) R_Y(\beta) R_X(\gamma) \\
& =\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
c \alpha & -s \alpha & 0 \\
s \alpha & c \alpha & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
c \beta & 0 & s \beta \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
-s \beta & 0 & c \beta
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & c \gamma & -s \gamma \\
0 & s \gamma & c \gamma
\end{array}\right]
\end{aligned} \tag{2.63}$$

- $c \alpha$: shorthand for $\cos \alpha$
- $s \alpha$: shorthand for $\sin \alpha$, and so on. 

It is extremely important to understand the order of rotations used in $(2.63)$. Thinking in terms of rotations as operators, we have applied the rotations (from the right) of $R_X(\gamma)$, then $R_Y(\beta)$, and then $R_Z(\alpha)$. Multiplying $(2.63)$ out, we obtain

$${}_B^A R_{X Y Z}(\gamma, \beta, \alpha)=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
c \alpha c \beta & c \alpha s \beta s \gamma-s \alpha c \gamma & c \alpha s \beta c \gamma+s \alpha s \gamma \\
s \alpha c \beta & s \alpha s \beta s \gamma+c \alpha c \gamma & s \alpha s \beta c \gamma-c \alpha s \gamma \\
-s \beta & c \beta s \gamma & c \beta c \gamma
\end{array}\right] \tag{2.64}$$

Keep in mind that the definition given here specifies the order of the three rotations. Equation $(2.64)$ is correct only for rotations performed in the order: about $\hat{X}_A$ by $\gamma$, about $\hat{Y}_A$ by $\beta$, about $\hat{Z}_A$ by $\alpha$.

The inverse problem, that of extracting equivalent `X-Y-Z fixed angles` from a rotation matrix, is often of interest. The solution depends on solving a set of transcendental equations: 
- there are $9$ equations and three unknowns if $(2.64)$ is equated to a given rotation matrix. 

Among the $9$ equations are $6$ dependencies, so, essentially, we have $3$ equations and $3$ unknowns. 

Let

$${ }_B^A R_{X Y Z}(\gamma, \beta, \alpha)=\left[\begin{array}{lll}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33}
\end{array}\right] \tag{2.65}$$

From $(2.64)$, we see that, by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of $r_{11}$ and $r_{21}$, we can compute $\cos \beta$. Then, we can solve for $\beta$ with the arc tangent of $-r_{31}$ over the computed cosine. Then, as long as $c \beta \neq 0$, we can solve for $\alpha$ by taking the arc tangent of $r_{21} / c \beta$ over $r_{11} / c \beta$ and we can solve for $\gamma$ by taking the arc tangent of $r_{32} / c \beta$ over $r_{33} / c \beta$.
In summary,

$$\begin{aligned}
& \beta=\operatorname{Atan} 2\left(-r_{31}, \sqrt{r_{11}^2+r_{21}^2} \right) \\
& \alpha=\operatorname{Atan} 2\left(r_{21} / c \beta, r_{11} / c \beta\right) \\
& \gamma=\operatorname{Atan} 2\left(r_{32} / c \beta, r_{33} / c \beta\right)
\end{aligned} \tag{2.66}
$$
where $\operatorname{Atan} 2(y, x)$ is a two-argument arc tangent function.

Although a second solution exists, by using the positive square root in the formula for $\beta$, we always compute the single solution for which $-90.0^{\circ} \leq \beta \leq 90.0^{\circ}$. This is usually a good practice, because we can then define one-to-one mapping functions between various representations of orientation. 

However, in some cases, calculating all solutions is important (more on this in Chapter 4). If $\beta= \pm 90.0^{\circ}$ (so that $c \beta=0$ ), the solution of (2.67) degenerates. In those cases, only the sum or the difference of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ can be computed. One possible convention is to choose $\alpha=0.0$ in these cases, which has the results given next.


If $\beta=90.0^{\circ}$, then a solution can be calculated to be
$$\begin{aligned}
& \beta=90.0^{\circ}, \\
& \alpha=0.0, \\
& \gamma=\operatorname{Atan} 2\left(r_{12}, r_{22}\right) .
\end{aligned}\tag{2.67}$$

If $\beta=-90.0^{\circ}$, then a solution can be calculated to be

$$\begin{aligned}
& \beta=-90.0^{\circ} \\
& \alpha=0.0 \\
& \gamma=-\operatorname{Atan} 2\left(r_{12}, r_{22}\right) .
\end{aligned}\tag{2.68}$$
