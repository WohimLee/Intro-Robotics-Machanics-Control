# Example 2.7

Consider two rotations, one about $\hat{Z}$ by 30 degrees and one about $\hat{X}$ by $30$ degrees:
$$\qquad\quad\ \  R_z(30)  =\begin{bmatrix}
0.866 & -0.500 & 0.000 \\
0.500 & 0.866 & 0.000 \\
0.000 & 0.000 & 1.000
\end{bmatrix} \tag{2.60}$$

$$\qquad\quad\ \  R_x(30)  =\begin{bmatrix}
1.000 & 0.000 & 0.000 \\
0.000 & 0.866 & -0.500 \\
0.000 & 0.500 & 0.866
\end{bmatrix} \tag{2.61}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
R_z(30) R_x(30) & =\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
0.87 & -0.43 & 0.25 \\
0.50 & 0.75 & -0.43 \\
0.00 & 0.50 & 0.87
\end{array}\right] \\
\neq R_x(30) R_z(30) & =\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
0.87 & -0.50 & 0.00 \\
0.43 & 0.75 & -0.50 \\
0.25 & 0.43 & 0.87
\end{array}\right]\tag{2.62}
\end{aligned}$$
The fact that the order of rotations is important should not be surprising; furthermore, it is captured in the fact that we use matrices to represent rotations, because multiplication of matrices is not commutative in general.


Because rotations can be thought of 
- either as operators 
- or as descriptions of orientation

it is not surprising that different representations are favored for each of these uses. Rotation matrices are useful as operators. Their matrix form is such that, when multiplied by a vector, they perform the rotation operation. 

However, rotation matrices are somewhat unwieldy when used to specify an orientation. 

A human operator at a computer terminal who wishes to type in the specification of the desired orientation of a robot's hand would have a hard time inputting a 9-element matrix with orthonormal colunms. A representation that requires only 3 numbers would be simpler. 

The following sections introduce several such representations.
