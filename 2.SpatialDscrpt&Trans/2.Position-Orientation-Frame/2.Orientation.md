# Description of a orientation
Often, we will find it necessary not only to represent a `point` in space but also to describe the `orientation` of a body in space. 

For example, if vector ${}^AP$ locates the point directly between the fingertips of a manipulator's hand, the complete location of the hand is still not specified until its orientation is also given.

Assuming that the manipulator has a sufficient number of joints,the hand could be oriented arbitrarily while keeping the point between the fingertips at the same position in space. 

In order to describe the orientation of a body, we will attach a coordinate system to the body and then give a description of this coordinate system relative to the reference system.

In Fig. 2.2, coordinate system $\{B\}$ has been attached to the body in a known way. $A$ description of $\{B\}$ relative to $\{A\}$ now suffices to give the orientation of the body.

Thus
- positions of points: are described with vectors
- orientations of bodies: are described with an attached coordinate system

One way to describe the body attached coordinate system, $\{B\}$, is to write the unit vectors of its three principal axes in terms of the coordinate system $\{A\}$.

&emsp;
## Rotation Matrix
>Unit Vectors

We denote the `unit vectors` giving the principal directions of coordinate system $\{B\}$ as: $X_B$, $Y_B$ and $Z_B$. 

>In terms of coordinate system $\{A\}$

When written in terms of coordinate system $\{A\}$, they are called ${}^AX_{B}$, ${}^AY_{B}$ and ${}^AZ_{B}$. 

>Rotation Matrix

It will be convenient if we stack these three unit vectors together as the columns of a $3 x 3$ matrix, in the order ${}^A\hat{X}_{B}$, ${}^A\hat{Y}_{B}$, ${}^A\hat{Z}_{B}$. We will callthis matrix a rotation matrix, and, because this particular rotation matrix describes $\{B\}$ relative to $\{A\}$, we name it with the notation ${}^A_BR$ (the choice of leading suband superscripts in the definition of rotation matrices wifi become clear in following sections):

$${}^A_B R=[{}^A\hat{X}_{B}, {}^A\hat{Y}_{B}, {}^A\hat{Z}_{B}] = \begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} \end{bmatrix} \tag{2.2}$$


In summary, a set of three vectors may be used to specify an orientation. 

For convenience, we will construct a $3 \times 3$ matrix that has these three vectors as its colunms. 

Hence, 
- the position of a point: is represented with a `vector`
- the orientation of a body: is represented with a `matrix` 

In Section 2.8, we will consider some other descriptions of orientation that require only three parameters.

We can give expressions for the scalars $r_{ij}$ in $R$ by noting that the components of any vector are simply the projections of that vector onto the unit directions of its reference frame. Hence, each component of $R^{AB}$ can be written as the `dot product` of a pair of unit vectors:


$${}^A_B R=[{}^A\hat{X}_{B}, {}^A\hat{Y}_{B}, {}^A\hat{Z}_{B}] $$

$$= \Big([\hat{X}_B, \hat{Y}_B, \hat{Z}_B]^T\cdot [\hat{X}_A, \hat{Y}_A, \hat{Z}_A]\Big)^T $$

$$=\begin{bmatrix}
X_BX_A & Y_BX_A & Z_BX_A \\
X_BY_A & Y_BY_A & Z_BY_A \\
X_BZ_A & Y_BZ_A & Z_BZ_A \end{bmatrix} \tag{2.3}$$


For brevity, we have omitted the leading superscripts in the rightmost matrix. In fact, the choice of frame in which to describe the unit vectors is arbitrary as long as it is the same for each pair being dotted. The dot product of two unit vectors yields the `cosine` of the angle between them, so it is clear why the components of rotation matrices are often referred to as direcfion cosines.

Further inspection of (2.3) shows that the rows of the matrix are the unit vectors of {A} expressed in {B}; that is,

$${}^A_B R=[{}^A\hat{X}_{B}, {}^A\hat{Y}_{B}, {}^A\hat{Z}_{B}] = \begin{bmatrix}
    ({}^BX_{A})^T \\\\ ({}^BY_{A})^T \\ \\ ({}^BZ_{A})^T 
\end{bmatrix} \tag{2.4}$$


Hence, the description of frame $\{A\}$ relative to $\{B\}$, is given by the transpose of $R_{BA}$; that is

$${}^B_AR = {}^A_BR^T \tag{2.5}$$

This suggests that the inverse of a rotation matrix is equal to its transpose, a fact that can be easily verified as

$${}^A_BR^T\ {}^B_AR = \begin{bmatrix}
{}^AX_B^T \\\\ {}^AY_B^T \\\\ {}^AZ_B^T 
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
    {}^AX_B , {}^AY_B , {}^AZ_B 
\end{bmatrix} = I_3 \tag{2.6}$$

where $I_3$ is the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix. Hence,

$${}^A_BR={}^B_AR^{-1}={}^B_AR^T \tag{2.7}$$
Indeed, from linear algebra [1], we know that the inverse of a matrix with orthonormal columns is equal to its transpose. We have just shown this geometrically.
