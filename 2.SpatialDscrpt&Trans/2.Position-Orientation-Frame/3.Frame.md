# Description of a frame


The information needed to completely specify the whereabouts of the manipulator hand in Fig. 2.2 is a position and an orientation.

The point on the body whose position we describe could be chosen arbitrarily, however. For convenience, the point whose position we will describe is chosen as the origin of the body-attached frame. The situation of a position and an orientation pair arises so often in robotics that we define an entity called a frame, which is a set of four vectors giving position and orientation information. 

For example, in Fig. 2.2, one vector locates the fingertip position and three more describe its orientation. 

Equivalently, the description of a frame can be thought of as
- a position vector
- a rotation matrix

Note that a frame is a coordinate system where, in addition to the orientation, we give a position vector which locates its origin relative to some other embedding frame. For example, frame $\{B\}$ is described by and ${}^A_BR$ where ${}^AP_{B\ ORG}$ is the vector that locates the origin of the frame $\{B\}$:

$$\{B\}=\left\{{}_B^A R,{}^A P_{B\ ORG}\right\} \tag{2.8}$$


In Fig. 2.3, there are three frames that are shown along with the universe coordinate system. Frames $\{A\}$ and $\{B\}$ are known relative to the universe coordinate system, and frame $\{C\}$ is known relative to frame $\{A\}$.

In Fig. 2.3, we introduce a graphical representation of frames, which is convenient in visualizing frames. $A$ frame is depicted by three arrows representing unit vectors defining the principal axes of the frame. An arrow representing a vector is drawn from one origin to another. This vector represents the position of the origin at the head of the arrow in terms of the frame at the tail of the arrow. The direction of this locating arrow tells us, for example, in Fig. 2.3, that $\{C\}$ is known relative to $\{A\}$ and not vice versa.

In summary, a frame can be used as a description of one coordinate system relative to another. A frame encompasses two ideas by representing both `position` and `orientation` and so may be thought of as a generalization of those two ideas.
- Positions could be represented by a frame whose rotation-matrix part is the identity matrix and whose position-vector part locates the point being described. 
- Orientation could be represented by a frame whose position-vector part was the zero vector.
