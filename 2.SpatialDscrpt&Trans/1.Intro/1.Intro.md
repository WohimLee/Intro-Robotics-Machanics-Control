Robotic manipulation, by definition, implies that `parts` and `tools` will be moved around in space by some sort of mechanism. This naturally leads to a need for representing `positions` and `orientations` of parts, of tools, and of the mechanism itself. 

To define and manipulate mathematical quantities that represent position and orientation, we must define coordinate systems and develop conventions for representation. 

Many of the ideas developed here in the context of position and orientation will form a basis for our later consideration of linear and rotational:
- velocities
- forces
- torques

>Universe Coordinate System

We adopt the philosophy that somewhere there is a `universe coordinate system` to which everything we discuss can be referenced. 

We will describe all positions and orientations with respect to the universe coordinate system or with respect to other Cartesian coordinate systems that are (or could be) defined relative to the universe system.
